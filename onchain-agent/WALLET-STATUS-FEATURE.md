# Wallet Status & Payment Source Feature

## Overview
Enhanced Pet Store modal with clear wallet connection status, balance display, and explicit indication that payments come from the user's wallet (not pet wallet).

## Problem Solved
- Users were confused about which wallet payments were coming from
- Wallet initialization issues were not visible to users
- No way to reconnect/repair wallet without refreshing
- Payments could be attempted even when wallet wasn't properly initialized

## New Features

### 1. **Wallet Connection Status Indicator** 
Located in the Pet Store modal header, showing real-time connection state.

#### States:
- 🟢 **Connected**: Green dot + "User Wallet Connected"
- 🔴 **Disconnected**: Red button "Reconnect Wallet" (clickable)
- ⏳ **Checking**: Spinner + "Checking..."

#### Implementation:
```tsx
{isCheckingWallet ? (
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-1 text-xs text-white/80">
    <div className="w-2 h-2 border border-white/60 border-t-white rounded-full animate-spin"></div>
    <span>Checking...</span>
  </div>
) : isWalletConnected ? (
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-1 text-xs">
    <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-green-400 rounded-full animate-pulse"></div>
    <span className="text-green-300 font-medium">User Wallet Connected</span>
  </div>
) : (
  <button onClick={handleWalletRepair} className="flex items-center space-x-1 text-xs bg-red-500/80 hover:bg-red-500 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full transition-colors">
    <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-white rounded-full"></div>
    <span>Reconnect Wallet</span>
  </button>
)}
```

### 2. **USDC Balance Display**
Shows user's wallet balance in real-time with status indicators.

#### Features:
- Live balance in USDC
- Truncated wallet address (0x1234...5678)
- Status messages:
  - ✅ "Ready to shop" (balance >= $1.00)
  - ⚠️ "Low balance" (balance < $1.00)
- Loading state with spinner
- Error handling with clear messages

### 3. **Payment Source Banner**
Blue info banner below header clearly stating payment source.

```
💳 Payment Source: All purchases will be paid from your connected User Wallet (not pet wallet)
```

Only shows when wallet is connected.

### 4. **Enhanced Buy Buttons**
BasePayButton now shows different states based on wallet connection:

#### When Wallet Connected:
```
💳 Pay from User Wallet
```

#### When Wallet Not Connected:
```
🔒 Wallet Required
```
or
```
🔒 Connect Wallet to Buy
```

#### Button States:
- **Disabled** when wallet not connected
- **Disabled** during wallet check
- **Enabled** only when wallet is verified and connected

### 5. **Automatic Wallet Verification**
When modal opens, automatically checks:

1. ✅ Wallet address is valid (not "pending-wallet-creation")
2. ✅ Wallet exists in database
3. ✅ Wallet has proper data for signing transactions
4. ✅ Sets connection state accordingly

```typescript
const checkWalletConnection = async () => {
  if (!userWalletAddress || userWalletAddress === 'pending-wallet-creation') {
    setIsWalletConnected(false);
    setWalletError('Wallet not initialized');
    return;
  }

  try {
    const walletCheckResponse = await fetch(`/api/wallet?address=${userWalletAddress}`);
    const walletData = await walletCheckResponse.json();
    
    if (!walletData.success || !walletData.wallet) {
      throw new Error('Wallet not properly initialized');
    }

    setIsWalletConnected(true);
    setWalletError(null);
  } catch (error) {
    setIsWalletConnected(false);
    setWalletError(error.message);
  }
};
```

### 6. **One-Click Wallet Repair**
New "Reconnect Wallet" button in header attempts automatic repair.

#### What it does:
1. Calls `/api/wallet` with `action: 'repairWallet'`
2. Fetches wallet from Coinbase SDK
3. Exports and saves wallet data
4. Refreshes balance
5. Shows success/error message

```typescript
const handleWalletRepair = async () => {
  try {
    const repairResponse = await fetch('/api/wallet', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        action: 'repairWallet',
        walletAddress: userWalletAddress
      })
    });

    const repairResult = await repairResponse.json();

    if (repairResult.success) {
      setIsWalletConnected(true);
      // Refresh balance
      const result = await getWalletUSDCBalance(userWalletAddress);
      setWalletBalance(result.balance);
      alert('Wallet repaired successfully! You can now make purchases.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    alert('Failed to repair wallet. Please refresh the page and try again.');
  }
};
```
