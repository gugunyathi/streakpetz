# Pet Store Wallet Status & Payment Fix - Complete Solution

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

### Issues Fixed:
1. ❌ Wallets not initializing properly for payments
2. ❌ Users confused about which wallet (user vs pet) was being charged  
3. ❌ No visibility into wallet connection status
4. ❌ Payments attempted even when wallet not ready
5. ❌ No way to recover from wallet issues without page refresh

## 🎯 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Wallet Connection Status Indicator**
- **Location**: Pet Store modal header
- **States**:
  - 🟢 **Connected**: "User Wallet Connected" (green dot, animated pulse)
  - 🔴 **Disconnected**: "Reconnect Wallet" button (red, clickable)
  - ⏳ **Checking**: Loading spinner with "Checking..."

### 2. **Real-Time USDC Balance Display**
- Shows current wallet balance
- Status indicators:
  - ✅ "Ready to shop" (balance >= $1.00)
  - ⚠️ "Low balance" (balance < $1.00)
- Truncated wallet address display (0x1234...5678)
- Loading states and error handling

### 3. **Payment Source Banner**
- Blue info banner clearly stating:
  > 💳 **Payment Source:** All purchases will be paid from your connected **User Wallet** (not pet wallet)
- Only visible when wallet is connected
- Eliminates confusion about wallet source

### 4. **Enhanced Buy Buttons**
- **When Connected**: Shows "💳 Pay from User Wallet"
- **When Disconnected**: Shows "🔒 Wallet Required" (disabled)
- **Disabled States**:
  - Wallet not connected
  - Wallet check in progress
  - Already owned items

### 5. **Automatic Wallet Verification**
On modal open, system checks:
- ✅ Wallet address is valid
- ✅ Wallet exists in database  
- ✅ Wallet has required data for transactions
- ✅ Network is correct (Base Sepolia)

### 6. **One-Click Wallet Repair**
- "Reconnect Wallet" button in header
- Automatically attempts wallet repair
- If repair impossible, offers page refresh with confirmation
- Clear success/error messaging

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### New State Variables (PetStoreModal.tsx)
```typescript
const [isWalletConnected, setIsWalletConnected] = useState(false);
const [isCheckingWallet, setIsCheckingWallet] = useState(false);
const [walletError, setWalletError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Key Functions Added

#### 1. `checkWalletConnection()`
```typescript
const checkWalletConnection = async () => {
  // Validates wallet address
  // Checks wallet exists in database
  // Verifies wallet data present
  // Sets connection state
};
```

#### 2. `handleWalletRepair()`
```typescript
const handleWalletRepair = async () => {
  // Calls repair endpoint
  // Handles success/failure
  // Offers page refresh if needed
  // Updates wallet state
};
```

### API Enhancements (app/api/wallet/route.ts)

#### Enhanced Repair Endpoint
```typescript
action: 'repairWallet' {
  // Fetches wallet from Coinbase
  // Attempts to export wallet data
  // Handles export failures gracefully
  // Returns clear error messages with suggestions
}
```

**Error Handling**:
- Cannot fetch wallet → "Wallet may need to be recreated"
- Cannot export (missing seed) → "Please refresh page" with suggestion
- Success → Wallet data saved, ready for transactions

### Component Updates

#### BasePayButton.tsx
- Already supports `children` prop for custom button text
- Respects `disabled` prop from parent
- Shows different states (processing, success, error)

#### PetStoreModal.tsx
- Header redesigned with wallet status section
- Payment source banner added
- Buy buttons show wallet source
- Disabled when wallet not connected
- Enhanced error messages
